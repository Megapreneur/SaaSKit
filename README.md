# SaaSKit
SaaSKit is a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS platform that demonstrates secure tenant isolation, role-based access control, subscription-based feature gating, and usage-aware scaling.



Problem Statement

Most SaaS applications fail when they need to:

* Support multiple organizations

* Enforce strict data isolation

* Scale permissions and roles

* Monetize usage without breaking existing customers


SaaSKit solves this by providing:

* A tenant-first architecture

* Centralized authorization

* Subscription-aware feature enforcement

* Scalable usage metering
